# SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym that represents five key design principles in software development. These guidelines help make code more maintainable, flexible, and scalable.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change. It must focus on a single responsibility or functionality.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. Extend behavior without altering existing code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. Subtypes must honor the expectations of the base type.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Break large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that implementing classes only need to be concerned with the methods that are relevant to them.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
